**Warning**: These widgets are designed for Windows 8.1, there is a good chance they will look different and/or bad on other operating systems.
If a widget does look bad or deviates from the native look on an operating system, feel free to send me an email with a screenshot of the widget and the name of the operating system you're using it on.
